# MyDearFriend
IOS GUI made by a programmer for programmers bypassing UX stuff we done understand anyway.

When creating simple application where I just want a simple meny for controlls it's always complicated for me as a programmer to use storyboards and tons of settings I have no clue of. 

So instead I want to use my dear friend to help me with that. Just create a single view application. Then init 'my dear friend' give him some settings and attatch to your view. Done!
